# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Cross-Platform Project Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the iOS mobile app project using Swift and SwiftUI as specified in the technical requirements.
# Details:
1. Set up native iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI
2. Initialize project using Xcode with appropriate iOS deployment targets
3. Set up project directory structure following iOS best practices:
   - /Models (data models and business logic)
   - /Views (SwiftUI views and components)
   - /ViewModels (view models for MVVM architecture)
   - /Services (API calls, authentication, etc.)
   - /Utils (helper functions and extensions)
   - /Resources (assets, fonts, localization files)
   - /Managers (system service managers)
4. Configure dependencies using Swift Package Manager:
   - Networking library (Alamofire or native URLSession wrapper)
   - Local storage solution (CoreData, UserDefaults wrapper)
   - Image handling (Kingfisher or similar)
5. Set up design system integration with Figma:
   - Create color and typography extensions
   - Implement design tokens
   - Set up component library structure
6. Configure SwiftLint for code quality
7. Implement modern iOS architecture patterns:
   - MVVM for presentation layer
   - Coordinator pattern for navigation
   - Repository pattern for data access
8. Set up basic CI/CD pipeline for iOS

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify project builds successfully on iOS simulator and devices
2. Run basic smoke tests to ensure app launches
3. Verify directory structure follows established iOS patterns
4. Ensure all development scripts work as expected
5. Verify SwiftUI previews are working correctly
6. Test design system components match Figma specifications
7. Validate Swift Package Manager dependencies resolve correctly
