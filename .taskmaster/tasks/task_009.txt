# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Location Tracking and Permissions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the location tracking system with appropriate permissions handling and privacy controls using CoreLocation.
# Details:
1. Implement location service with methods using CoreLocation:
   - getCurrentLocation()
   - startLocationTracking(options)
   - stopLocationTracking()
   - updateLocation(location)
2. Add permission request handling for location access using CLLocationManager
3. Implement background location tracking with battery optimization using Background Modes
4. Create location state management using Combine publishers
5. Add geofencing capabilities for game boundaries and safe zones using CLCircularRegion
6. Implement location spoofing detection
7. Create privacy controls for location sharing
8. Add location caching for offline support using Core Data

# Test Strategy:
1. Test location permission requests on iOS
2. Verify background location tracking with Background Modes
3. Test geofencing triggers for boundaries
4. Measure battery impact of location tracking
5. Test location spoofing detection
6. Verify location accuracy in different environments
7. Test offline location caching with Core Data
8. Verify proper handling of location permission changes
