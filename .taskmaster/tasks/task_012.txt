# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Kill Reporting System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the kill reporting system with multiple verification methods (GPS, NFC, Photo, Manual) using iOS frameworks.
# Details:
1. Create kill reporting service with methods:
   - reportKill(gameId, targetId, method, evidence)
   - verifyKill(killId, verified)
   - disputeKill(killId, reason)
   - getKillHistory(gameId)
2. Implement verification methods:
   - GPS proximity verification using CoreLocation
   - NFC tag scanning using CoreNFC
   - Photo evidence with AI verification using Vision framework
   - Manual admin verification
3. Design and implement Kill Report screen with SwiftUI:
   - Target information
   - Verification method selection
   - Evidence collection (photo using UIImagePickerController, location)
   - Submission confirmation
4. Create kill verification flow for victims
5. Implement dispute system for contested kills
6. Add admin review interface for disputed kills
7. Create kill feed with recent eliminations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test kill reporting service methods using XCTest
2. Test each verification method
3. Verify kill report submission flow
4. Test dispute and resolution process
5. Verify admin review functionality
6. Test kill feed updates
7. Verify notification delivery for kill events
8. Use XCUITest for UI testing of kill reporting flow
