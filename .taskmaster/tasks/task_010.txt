# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Map Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the interactive game map showing player location, target's approximate location, safe zones, and game boundaries using MapKit.
# Details:
1. Integrate MapKit with SwiftUI using Map view
2. Create custom map styling with dark tactical theme
3. Implement map components:
   - Player marker using MKAnnotation
   - Target marker (with approximate location)
   - Safe zone overlays using MKCircle
   - Game boundary polygon using MKPolygon
4. Add map controls:
   - Zoom controls
   - Center on player
   - Toggle layers
5. Implement real-time updates for player and target positions
6. Create map state management using Combine
7. Add animations for marker movements
8. Implement map caching for offline support using MKMapSnapshotter

# Test Strategy:
1. Test map rendering on different iOS devices
2. Verify marker placement accuracy
3. Test real-time updates of positions
4. Verify safe zone and boundary visualization
5. Test map controls and interactions
6. Measure performance with multiple markers
7. Test offline map functionality
8. Verify proper handling of location permission changes
