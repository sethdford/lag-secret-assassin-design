# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Anti-Cheating Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create anti-cheating measures including location spoofing detection and verification systems for iOS.
# Details:
1. Implement location spoofing detection:
   - Check for developer mode
   - Analyze location jump patterns
   - Verify location consistency
2. Create verification service with methods:
   - verifyLocation(location)
   - reportSuspiciousActivity(userId, reason)
   - reviewReports(gameId)
3. Add server-side verification for critical actions
4. Implement time-based verification tokens
5. Create admin review interface for suspicious activity
6. Add player reporting functionality
7. Implement automated ban system for confirmed cheaters

# Test Strategy:
1. Test location spoofing detection with simulated locations
2. Verify suspicious activity reporting
3. Test admin review interface
4. Verify time-based token validation
5. Test player reporting functionality
6. Verify automated ban system
7. Conduct penetration testing for security vulnerabilities
8. Use XCTest for testing anti-cheating measures
