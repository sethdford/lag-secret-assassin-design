# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Safe Zones System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the safe zone system with different types (PUBLIC, PRIVATE, TIMED, RELOCATABLE) using CoreLocation and MapKit.
# Details:
1. Create safe zone service with methods:
   - getSafeZones(gameId)
   - createSafeZone(gameId, zoneData)
   - updateSafeZone(zoneId, zoneData)
   - deleteSafeZone(zoneId)
   - checkInSafeZone(location)
2. Implement safe zone types:
   - PUBLIC: Available to all players
   - PRIVATE: Available to specific players
   - TIMED: Active during specific time periods
   - RELOCATABLE: Can be moved by admins
3. Design and implement Safe Zones screen with SwiftUI:
   - List of active safe zones
   - Map visualization using MapKit
   - Safe zone creation (for admins)
   - Safe zone status indicators
4. Add geofencing for safe zone entry/exit detection using CLCircularRegion
5. Implement notifications for safe zone events using UNUserNotificationCenter
6. Create safe zone visualization on map using MKCircle overlays
7. Add private safe zone management for eligible players

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test safe zone service methods using XCTest
2. Test geofencing for different safe zone types
3. Verify safe zone creation and management
4. Test notifications for safe zone entry/exit
5. Verify visualization on map
6. Test time-based safe zone activation/deactivation
7. Verify private safe zone access controls
8. Use XCUITest for UI testing of safe zone management
