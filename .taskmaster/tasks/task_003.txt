# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Authentication Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the authentication system with JWT-based authentication including sign up, sign in, and password reset functionality for iOS.
# Details:
1. Create authentication service with the following methods:
   - signUp(email, password, displayName)
   - signIn(email, password)
   - resetPassword(email)
   - signOut()
   - refreshToken()
2. Implement JWT token storage and management using Keychain
3. Create authentication state management using Combine framework
4. Build authentication screens with SwiftUI:
   - Splash screen with initialization logic
   - Welcome screen with app introduction
   - Sign In screen with email/password form
   - Sign Up screen with registration form
   - Forgot Password screen with reset flow
5. Implement form validation and error handling using Combine validators
6. Add secure token storage using Keychain Services API
7. Create protected view system for authenticated content using ViewModifiers

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test authentication service methods using XCTest
2. Test form validation for all edge cases
3. Verify JWT token storage and refresh mechanism
4. Test authentication flows (happy path and error scenarios)
5. Verify secure storage of credentials in Keychain
6. Test password reset flow end-to-end
7. Use XCUITest for UI testing of authentication flows
