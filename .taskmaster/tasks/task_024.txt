# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 15, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize app performance for battery usage, data consumption, and load times on iOS.
# Details:
1. Implement battery optimization strategies:
   - Adjust location tracking frequency based on game state
   - Optimize background processes using BGTaskScheduler
   - Implement efficient wake locks
2. Create data usage optimization:
   - Compress network requests
   - Implement efficient caching using URLCache
   - Add data usage settings
3. Optimize load times:
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Add asset preloading
   - Optimize image loading using UIImage caching
4. Create performance monitoring service using MetricKit
5. Implement memory usage optimization
6. Add performance settings for user control
7. Create battery usage analytics

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure battery consumption in different scenarios using Instruments
2. Track data usage for typical game sessions
3. Test load times across different iOS devices
4. Verify performance monitoring accuracy
5. Test memory usage under load using Instruments
6. Verify performance settings effectiveness
7. Conduct performance benchmarking
8. Use XCTest for performance testing
